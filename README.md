# Econometrics-coursework

A compulsory paper in 2nd year Economics at Cambridge is Econometrics. 40% of the grade for this paper comes from an empirical project, the title of which each student chooses from four options that change every year. The word limit is 2000 words (which I find quite degrading), excluding at most 8 tables and figures.

This is my work in the format it was submitted, with the prompt on the first page. It received a mark of 86. Due to the Covid-19 situation, our written exams were cancelled the econometrics project was the only officially marked assignment.
